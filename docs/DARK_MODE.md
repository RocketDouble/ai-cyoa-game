# Dark Mode Implementation

Dark mode has been successfully added to your AI CYOA Game!

## Features

- **Automatic Theme Persistence**: Your theme preference is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions
- **Toggle Button**: A sun/moon icon button in the header lets you switch between light and dark modes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All components have been updated with dark mode styles:
  - App layout (header, footer, main content)
  - Settings panel (all inputs, buttons, and validation messages)
  - Error boundaries and loading screens
  - Navigation buttons

## How It Works

### Theme Context
- Located in `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
- Manages theme state and provides `toggleTheme()` and `setTheme()` functions
- Automatically applies the `dark` class to the `<html>` element

### Tailwind Configuration
- Dark mode is enabled with `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`
- Uses Tailwind's `dark:` variant for all dark mode styles

### Theme Toggle Component
- Located in `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Shows a moon icon in light mode and sun icon in dark mode
- Placed in the header navigation for easy access

## Usage

The theme toggle button appears in the header on all screens except the welcome screen. Simply click it to switch between light and dark modes.

## Color Scheme

### Light Mode
- Background: Gray-100
- Cards: White
- Text: Gray-900
- Borders: Gray-300

### Dark Mode
- Background: Gray-900
- Cards: Gray-800
- Text: Gray-100
- Borders: Gray-700

All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.) have appropriate hover states and focus rings in both modes.
